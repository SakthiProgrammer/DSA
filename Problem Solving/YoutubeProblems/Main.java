         * Try think basically of different ways to solve problem
         * Think end-to-end (E2E) of the best solutions based on complexity
         * Write the algorithm from patterns in drawing
         * Code it out
         * Try and improve it once you think you're finished
         * Go through other solutions (even if you answered correctly).
